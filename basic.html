        <ul>I have been writing for about 4 years now, and I really do enjoy it. It's peaceful, it's calming, and it's just interesting for me. I started writng poems because I was inspired by them, the rhyming, the wording coming together as one, It's just a relaxing hobby.
            Now when I do have more free time I tend to play sports like Volleyball. Volleyball is a team sport were I can be myself and freely play and maybe even learn new skills. For me, Volleyball is a great sport, having and feeling that contact with the ball is the best feeling you could get. 
            I also enjoy playing Basketball and Football, which are contact sports with another player, and is really fun to enjoy.</ul>
